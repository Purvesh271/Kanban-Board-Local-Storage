# Kanban Board

An interactive Kanban board that helps users manage tasks across different workflow stages with drag-and-drop functionality and persistent storage.

## 🚀 Features

- Create new tasks and add them to the board  
- Drag and drop tasks between **To Do**, **In Progress**, and **Completed** columns  
- Real-time task count displayed for each column  
- Delete individual tasks  
- Automatic data persistence using **localStorage**
